# go22dos

A basic TODOs app tailored to my personal needs.

go22dos creates/writes to/reads from a json file (_.go22dos) within the
directory it's been executed in. Basic functionalities are documented at
startup.

For now, this is a basic hobby project and by no means considered to be stable.
For more details on certain intricacies, feel free to issue a question.
